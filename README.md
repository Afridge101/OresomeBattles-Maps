OresomeBattles-Maps
===================

Configuration files for OresomeBattles maps.

This is a addon (but required) plugin to OresomeBattles. This plugin is what handles the maps, using OresomeBattle's API.

This is here to hopefully be helpful to those trying to configure their own maps and for the people who may want to cover more advancted topics such as item renaming.

If you want to submit your own map, feel free to make a pull request!

You may make pull requests for existing maps, but it's likely that it will not be accepted.
