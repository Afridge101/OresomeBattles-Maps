Interested in having your map added to OresomeCraft Battles? Oresome! Just make sure your pull request follows these guidelines

* **Follow the [Oracle coding conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html).**
  We can't stress this enough; if your code has notable issues, it may delay
  the process significantly.
* **Target Java 6 for source and compilation.**
* **Use only spaces for indentation.** Our indents are 4-spaces long, and tabs
  are unacceptable.
* **Don't tag classes with messages like 'configured by <username>', etc**
* **Test your code.** We're not interested in broken code, for the obvious reasons.
* **Commits made should always be made in the present tense. For example, "Added ..." is not appriopriate. "Add CastleMap" is appropriate.**


Checklist
---------

Ready to submit? Perform the checklist below:

1. Have all tabs been replaced into four spaces? Are indentations 4-space wide?
2. Does the code work? Did you follow the guide exactly?

Example
-------

This is **GOOD:**

```java
    if (var.func(param1, param2)) {
        // do things
    }
```

This is **EXTREMELY BAD:**

```java
    if(var.func( param1, param2 ))
    {
        // do things
    }
```
